    Java main method in detail.

    public static void main(String[] args)

 -> main method protype is checked by JVM at run time. compiler won't check for main method in class whether it is present or not. 

1. Why method name is main? can we change it?
    -> main method called by JVM. 
    -> JVM always look for the below prototype.

    public static void main(String[] args)

    -> In JVM program the protype is set as above.
    -> If we want to change main method name then we have to change JVM configuration.


2. Why main method is public?

    -> Because JVM can access form anywhere. not based on it's location.

3. why main method is static?

    -> Because JVM can call main method without existing object of class.

4. Why main method return type is void?

    -> Because JVM call the main method and if we return any thing to JVM then we don't have access to that.
    -> So it is strictly void type.

5.  What is String[] args?

    -> it is command line argument which is strictly String array and args is the name of array.
    -> we can change args to any name we like to have.



-> main method Syntax is very strict.
-> we can change some Syntax of main method like "Access Modifiers".
-> public static void main(String[] args) to static public void main(String[] args)
