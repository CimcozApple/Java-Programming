        JAVA COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT

    -> Why we need command line argument?
        -> To customise behaviour of the main method.

    -> java Test.java A B C

        public class Test{
            public static void main(String[] args){
                System.out.println(args[0]);
                System.out.println(args[1]);
                System.out.println(args[2]);
            }
        }

        Output:-
            A
            B
            C
    

    -> Why String Array?
        -> Because most commanly used type is java is String and we can convert those in other type easily.


    -> JVM is responsible to create and pass it to the main method as a argument.
