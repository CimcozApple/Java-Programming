        Java Variables.


1. Division one
    -> Two types of variable based on the data represented by variable. 
        -> Primitive variables. int a = 10;
        -> reference variables. String s = new String("yp");

2. Division Two
    -> Three types of variable based on the declaration. 
        -> Instance variable.
        -> Static variable.
        -> local variable.


    1. Instance variable.
        -> variable declared directly inside a class outside the method, block and constructor are called instance variable.
        -> It can be Primitive or reference type.
        -> Separate copy will be created for each object.
        -> Scope of instance variable is same as a Scope of object.
        -> JVM will provide default value for instance variable.
        -> Instance variable is created at the time of object creation.
        -> Instance variable stored in a heap memory as a part of object.
        -> Instance variable are called as a object level Variables and attributes.
        -> We are not able access instance variable directly from the static context. we can make use of object to access instance variable in static context.
        -> we can access instance variable directly from the non-static context.
        
        public class Test{
            int x;
            double y;
            String z;
            public static void main(String[] args){
                System.out.println(x); //We get compile time error. because we are using instance variable inside static context.
                Test t = new Test();
                System.out.println(t.x); //0
                System.out.println(t.y); //0.0
                System.out.println(t.z); //null
            }

            //non static context.
            public void m1(){
                System.out.println(x); //0
                System.out.println(y); //0.0
                System.out.println(z); //null
            }
        }


    2. Static variable.
        -> variable with static keyword and declared directly inside a class outside the method, block and constructor are called static variable.
        -> It can be Primitive or reference type.
        -> one copy will be created and shared amog the all object.
        ->  Scope of static variable is same as a Scope of class.
        -> JVM will provide default value for static variable.
        -> static variable is created at the time of class loading.
        -> static variable stored in method memory.
        -> static variable are called as a class level Variables and fields.
        -> we can access static variable using class name as well as using object from the static and non static context.
        -> Inside the same class directly we can access static variable.
